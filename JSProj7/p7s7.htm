  <h3>The Wolf and the Lamb</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
        WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay
        violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the
        Wolf’s right to eat him.<p> He thus addressed him: “Sirrah, last year you
        grossly insulted me.” “Indeed,” bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone
        of voice, “I was not then born.” Then said the Wolf, “You feed in my
        pasture.” “No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted
        grass.” Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.”“No,” exclaimed the
        Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both food
        and drink to me.” Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
        “Well! I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my
        imputations.”</p>  The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

  <h3>The Fisherman Piping</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
        A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the
        seashore.<p> Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the
        hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord
        dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long
        waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the
        sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in
        the net upon the rock he said:</p> “O you most perverse creatures, when
        I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so
        merrily.”
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>The Ants and the Grasshopper</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
        THE ANTS were spending a fine winter’s day drying grain collected in
        the summertime.<p> A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and
        earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, “Why did
        you not treasure up food during the summer?” He replied, “I had not
        leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.” They then said in
        derision:</p> “If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must
        dance supperless to bed in the winter.”        
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>The Dog and the Shadow</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
        A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his
        mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another
        Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size.<p> He immediately let go
        of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece
        from him. He thus lost both:</p> that which he grasped at in the water,
        because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.
